        Every lab meeting surfaces promising directions. Without a system to track and
        compare them, the evidence sits fragmented -- no one can reliably see the full
        picture. A postdoc reads a contradicting paper and files it under "interesting."
        A technician notices something unexpected but has no time to chase it down. These
        insights are real, but without infrastructure to persist them, they fade.

        The ideas that do surface face a harder problem: finite bench hours, finite
        instrument budget, finite analyst bandwidth. Ten good ideas compete for three
        experimental slots. The ones that get pursued are not always the ones best
        supported by evidence -- they are the ones someone had time to champion.

        The gap is not analytical skill. It is infrastructure.
