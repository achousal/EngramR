# Canonical color palettes for all research projects.
#
# Single source of truth: both Python (plot_theme.py) and R (palettes.R) load
# this file. Adding a new lab requires only adding an entry below.
#
# Palette names are lowercase lab slugs. Each value is a list of 8 hex colors.
# Semantic palettes (sex, dx, etc.) are shared across all labs.

# -- Semantic palettes (universal, all labs) -----------------------------------

semantic:
  sex:
    Male: "#377EB8"
    Female: "#E41A1C"
  dx:
    "P-": "#4DAF4A"
    "P+": "#E41A1C"
  binary:
    Control: "#4DAF4A"
    Case: "#E41A1C"
  direction:
    Up: "#E41A1C"
    Down: "#377EB8"
    NS: "#999999"
  sig:
    sig: "#E41A1C"
    "not sig": "#999999"

# -- Diverging and sequential palette names ------------------------------------

diverging: "RdBu_r"
sequential: "Blues"

# -- Lab-specific categorical palettes -----------------------------------------
# Each lab gets up to 8 hex colors for categorical variables.
# "elahi" uses ColorBrewer Set1. "chipuk" uses Okabe-Ito.
# New labs: add an entry here and both Python and R pick it up automatically.
