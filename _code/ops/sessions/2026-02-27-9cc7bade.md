## Session Summary
Makes sense -- once you onboard from a clean slate, `/onboard` will create the project note with the Key Docs bridge and wire everything into the graph from the start. The methodology is already in place to prevent this; it just hadn't been run yet.

Good luck with the fresh onboarding.
