## Statement
Higher baseline variability in repeated measurements predicts better six-month treatment response, independently of baseline severity and demographic covariates.

## Mechanism
Greater measurement variability at baseline reflects system flexibility -- systems with higher dynamic range retain capacity for treatment-induced change.

## Literature Grounding
- Author et al. 2024: baseline variability associated with treatment response
- Author et al. 2023: dynamic range as a predictor of adaptive capacity

## Testable Predictions
- [ ] Baseline variability is significantly higher in responders vs non-responders
- [ ] Variability-response correlation remains after adjusting for baseline severity and age

## Proposed Experiments
Linear regression of treatment response ~ baseline variability + baseline severity + age + sex in the longitudinal cohort.

## Assumptions
- Assumption 1: Repeated baseline measurements capture meaningful variability -- Status: supported
- Assumption 2: Treatment response can be quantified as a continuous outcome -- Status: supported

## Limitations & Risks
Small sample size may limit power for interaction effects.
