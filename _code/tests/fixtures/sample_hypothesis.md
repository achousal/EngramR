## Statement
Plasma GFAP levels are elevated in amyloid-positive individuals and correlate with amyloid PET SUVr independently of age and sex.

## Mechanism
Astrocytic activation in response to amyloid plaque deposition leads to GFAP release into CSF and subsequently plasma.

## Literature Grounding
- Benedet et al. 2021: plasma GFAP associated with amyloid pathology
- Pereira et al. 2021: GFAP outperforms NfL for amyloid prediction

## Testable Predictions
- [ ] GFAP is significantly higher in P+ vs P- groups
- [ ] GFAP-amyloid correlation remains after adjusting for age and sex

## Proposed Experiments
Linear regression of plasma GFAP ~ amyloid SUVr + age + sex in the AD cohort.

## Assumptions
- Assumption 1: Plasma GFAP reflects central astrocytic activation -- Status: supported
- Assumption 2: Amyloid PET SUVr is a reliable proxy for plaque burden -- Status: supported

## Limitations & Risks
Small sample size may limit power for interaction effects.
