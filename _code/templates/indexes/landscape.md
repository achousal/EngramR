# Hypothesis Landscape Index

Per-goal landscape maps are stored in `_research/landscape/`.

## Landscapes

| Research Goal | File | Clusters | Gaps | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## How to use
- Run `/landscape` from the co-scientist menu to generate a landscape for the active research goal.
- Each goal gets its own file at `_research/landscape/{goal-slug}.md`.
- The landscape includes clusters, gaps, redundancies, and suggested directions.
