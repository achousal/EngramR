# /init -- Design Notes

## Why This Skill Exists

First notes matter disproportionately: they set graph topology and get the best context-window processing quality. Without guided seeding, users face a blank graph with no structural foundation, leading to:

- Orientation claims that should be explicit remain implicit
- Confounders discovered late (positive-first bias)
- Methodological requirements independently rediscovered across programs
- No falsification structure in the graph

/init addresses these by structuring the first session around: orientation (what are we studying?), methodology (how do we study it?), confounders (what could fool us?), and inversions (what would prove us wrong?).

The `--cycle` mode addresses cycle-transition gaps: no formal handoff between research cycles, daemon-vs-human priority drift, and stale inversions that were never updated with new evidence.
