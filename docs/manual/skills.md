## Co-Scientist Skills

### Tier 1: Supervisor

#### /research
Orchestrate the co-scientist generate-debate-evolve loop.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (entry point) |
| Invokes | /generate, /review, /tournament, /evolve, /landscape, /meta-review, /literature |
| Reads | _research/goals/, _research/hypotheses/_index.md, _research/meta-reviews/ |
| Writes | _research/goals/ |

Sets research goals and presents a menu of co-scientist operations. Before invoking any sub-skill, checks _research/meta-reviews/ for the latest feedback and injects it as context. The user drives the loop -- the supervisor never auto-advances.

---

### Tier 2: Co-Scientist Agents

#### /generate
Produce novel, literature-grounded hypotheses for a research goal.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/goals/, _research/meta-reviews/, _research/landscape/, _research/hypotheses/ |
| Writes | _research/hypotheses/, _research/hypotheses/_index.md |

**4 generation modes:**
1. **Literature synthesis** -- search PubMed/arXiv (when configured via domain profile), identify gaps, propose hypotheses with citations.
2. **Self-play debate** -- simulate expert perspectives (molecular biologist, clinician, statistician), extract novel ideas.
3. **Assumption-based reasoning** -- take an existing hypothesis, enumerate assumptions, generate alternatives by relaxing each.
4. **Research expansion** -- use meta-review feedback and landscape gaps to target under-explored regions.

Output: hypothesis notes with Elo=1200, generation=1, status=proposed.

---

#### /review
Critically evaluate hypotheses through multiple review lenses.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/hypotheses/, _research/meta-reviews/ |
| Writes | _research/hypotheses/ (frontmatter: review_scores, review_flags, Review History) |

**6 review modes:**
1. **Quick screen** -- rapid assessment, scores on 1-10 scale (novelty, correctness, testability, impact, overall).
2. **Literature review** -- search for the claim in PubMed/arXiv (when configured via domain profile), flag if already published or contradicted.
3. **Deep verification** -- decompose into constituent assumptions, search evidence for each.
4. **Observation review** -- assess explanatory power against user-provided experimental data.
5. **Simulation review** -- walk through proposed mechanism step-by-step, identify failure modes.
6. **Tournament-informed review** -- apply learned critique patterns from previous meta-reviews.

Scoring: weighted mean -- correctness 30%, testability 25%, novelty 25%, impact 20%.

---

#### /tournament
Rank hypotheses through pairwise scientific debate with Elo ratings.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/hypotheses/, _research/goals/ |
| Writes | _research/tournaments/, _research/hypotheses/ (elo, matches, wins, losses), _research/hypotheses/_index.md |

Generates matchups prioritizing under-matched and similar-Elo pairs. Conducts structured debate across four dimensions (novelty, correctness, testability, impact). Tiered comparison: top 25% by Elo receive multi-turn deep debate; bottom 75% receive single-turn comparison.

Elo system: starting rating 1200, K-factor 32, rating sum preserved.

---

#### /evolve
Refine and evolve top-ranked hypotheses into stronger versions.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/hypotheses/, _research/meta-reviews/ |
| Writes | _research/hypotheses/ (new generation notes), _research/hypotheses/_index.md |

**5 evolution modes:**
1. **Grounding enhancement** -- strengthen evidence base, fix flagged assumptions.
2. **Combination** -- merge 2-3 top hypotheses, resolve contradictions.
3. **Simplification** -- strip non-essential assumptions, focus on testable core.
4. **Research extension** -- extend to adjacent domains, explore broader implications.
5. **Divergent exploration** -- generate contrarian alternatives, target empty landscape regions.

Output: new hypothesis with generation=N+1, parents linked bidirectionally, Elo=1200.

---

#### /landscape
Map the hypothesis space to identify clusters, gaps, and redundancies.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/hypotheses/ |
| Writes | _research/landscape/, _research/landscape.md |

Clusters hypotheses by shared tags, common assumptions, similar mechanisms, overlapping citations, and Elo tier. Outputs: cluster descriptions, identified gaps, redundancy flags, and suggested directions for /generate and /evolve.

---

#### /meta-review
Synthesize patterns from tournament debates and reviews into actionable feedback.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research |
| Reads | _research/tournaments/, _research/hypotheses/ (review histories) |
| Writes | _research/meta-reviews/ |

Analyzes: recurring weaknesses, key literature, invalid assumptions, winner patterns. Produces concrete recommendations for /generate (what types of hypotheses are missing) and /evolve (which weaknesses to address first). This output feeds back into subsequent cycles -- the self-improving loop mechanism.

---

#### /literature
Search configured search backends, create structured literature notes.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | /research, user (standalone) |
| Reads | Configured search backends (see `ops/config.yaml` `literature:` section) |
| Writes | _research/literature/, _research/literature/_index.md |

Searches configured backends (PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex -- controlled by `literature.sources` in config). Presents results as a table. Saves selected papers as structured notes with frontmatter (type, title, doi, authors, year, journal, status) and sections (Abstract, Key Points, Methods Notes, Relevance, Citations).

---

### Tier 3: Supporting Tools

#### /experiment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (standalone) |
| Reads | _research/hypotheses/ (linked hypothesis) |
| Writes | _research/experiments/, _research/experiments/_index.md, _research/hypotheses/ (linked_experiments) |

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (standalone) |
| Reads | User-provided dataset |
| Writes | eda-reports/, eda-reports/_index.md |

Auto-redacts PII columns (SubjectID, PersonName, SSN, Email, etc., plus profile-specific patterns) before analysis. Computes summary statistics, correlations, distribution properties. Generates themed plots (histograms, correlation heatmap, missing data chart). Saves report to vault.

---

#### /plot
Generate publication-quality figures using the canonical research theme.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (standalone) |
| Reads | User-provided data, `_code/styles/STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `_code/styles/PLOT_DESIGN.md`, profile `styles/PLOT_DESIGN.md` |
| Writes | User-specified output directory (PDF figures) |

---

#### /project
Register, update, and query research projects in the vault.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (standalone) |

## Knowledge Processing Skills

### Processing Pipeline

#### /reduce
Extract claims from source material in inbox/.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Path to an inbox/ file |
| Output | One or more claim notes in notes/ |
| Queue | Creates reflect tasks for each extracted claim |

Reads source material through the domain lens. Extracts claims across 6 categories: claims (testable assertions), evidence (data points), methodology comparisons, contradictions, open questions, design patterns. Each extracted claim must pass the quality bar: title works as prose, description adds beyond title, specific enough to disagree with.

---

#### /reflect
Find connections between claims and update topic maps.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Claim title or path (or operates on recent claims from queue) |
| Output | Updated claims with new wiki links, updated topic maps |
| Queue | Creates reweave tasks for connected claims |

Three connection-finding operations:
1. Forward connections -- what existing claims relate to this one?
2. Backward connections -- what older claims need updating?
3. Topic map membership -- ensures the claim appears in at least one topic map.

---

#### /reweave
Revisit old claims with new context.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Claim title or path |
| Output | Updated claim with revised content, new connections |
| Queue | Creates verify tasks |

Asks: "If I wrote this claim today, what would be different?" Reconsidering a claim based on current knowledge: add connections, rewrite content, sharpen the claim, split bundled ideas, challenge with new evidence. Scope configured in ops/config.yaml (related, broad, or full).

---

#### /verify
Quality-check claims against schema, description standards, and link health.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Claim title or path |
| Output | Verification report, fixes applied |

Three checks:
1. **Description quality (cold-read test)** -- read only title and description, predict content, then verify.
2. **Schema compliance** -- all required fields present, enum values valid.
3. **Link health** -- no broken wiki links, no orphaned claims.

---

#### /validate
Batch schema validation across all claims.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | None (operates on all notes/) |
| Output | Validation report with violations listed |

Checks every claim in notes/ against the _templates/claim-note.md schema. Reports missing required fields, invalid enum values, empty descriptions, and constraint violations.

---

#### /seed
Queue a source file for processing with duplicate detection.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Path to source file |
| Output | Extract task in ops/queue/, source archived |

Checks for duplicates, creates an archive folder, moves the source from inbox/ to its permanent archive location, creates an extract task file, and updates the queue. The next step is /ralph or /reduce to process the queued task. Does not create claims directly -- all claim creation goes through /reduce.

---

#### /pipeline
Process inbox items through the full pipeline (reduce-reflect-reweave-verify).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Path to inbox/ file or "all" |
| Output | Processed claims in notes/, updated topic maps |

Chains the full pipeline: reduce (extract) then reflect (connect) then reweave (revisit related) then verify (quality-check). Chaining mode follows ops/config.yaml setting (manual, suggested, or automatic).

---

#### /ralph
Orchestrate the full processing chain with fresh context per phase.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Path to inbox/ file |
| Output | Fully processed claims |

Named orchestrator for the complete pipeline. Manages context freshness by invoking each phase in a separate context window. Recommended for deep processing of important sources.

---

### Queue and Navigation

#### /tasks
View and manage the task queue.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Optional filter (phase, status) |
| Output | Task list from ops/queue/ |

Displays pipeline tasks tracked in ops/queue/queue.json. Each task tracks a claim through phases (create, reflect, reweave, verify). Supports filtering by phase and status.

---

#### /next
Intelligent next-action recommendation.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | None |
| Output | Prioritized recommendation with rationale |

Evaluates condition-based triggers and queue state. Fires maintenance conditions (orphan claims, dangling links, inbox pressure, pending observations, pending tensions, topic map size). Recommends the highest-priority action with a rationale. Priority derives from consequence speed: session-critical > multi-session > slow-burn.

---

#### /stats
Vault metrics and progress visualization.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | None |
| Output | Metrics report |

Reports: claim count, inbox count, observation count, tension count, topic map count, orphan count, dangling link count, average links per claim, queue depth by phase. Provides a snapshot of vault health and processing throughput.

---

#### /graph
Graph query generation and analysis.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Query type (triangles, clusters, bridges, orphans, influence) |
| Output | Analysis results |

Queries the wiki-link graph:
- **Triangle detection** -- find synthesis opportunities (A links B and C, but B and C are unlinked).
- **Cluster detection** -- find connected components and isolated knowledge islands.
- **Bridge detection** -- find structurally critical claims.
- **Orphan detection** -- claims with zero incoming links.
- **Influence flow** -- rank claims by hub/authority patterns.

---

### Research and Learning

#### /learn

---

### Self-Evolution

#### /remember
Capture friction and methodology learnings.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Observation description |
| Output | Observation note in ops/observations/ |

---

#### /onboard
Bootstrap lab integration -- scan filesystem, register projects, build data inventory, create research goals.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (first session entry point) |
| Context | main (orchestrator) + fork (sub-skills) |
| Reads | Lab filesystem, existing projects/, _research/data-inventory.md |
| Writes | projects/, _research/data-inventory.md, _research/goals/, self/goals.md |

**Architecture:** Main-context orchestrator with three fork sub-skills:
- `onboard-scan` -- filesystem discovery, convention mining, institution lookup
- `onboard-generate` -- vault artifact creation
- `onboard-verify` -- schema and link validation

Detailed instructions live in `reference/` files that sub-skills Read on demand. The orchestrator handles all user interaction as natural conversation turns (2-3 review turns). Runs once per lab; use `--update` for incremental re-scans. For multi-lab roots, onboards one lab at a time (depth-first). Natural next step is /init.

---

#### /init
Seed foundational knowledge claims for new vaults or cycle transitions.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Invoked by | User (after /onboard) |
| Context | main (orchestrator) + fork (sub-skills) |
| Reads | _research/goals/, self/, notes/, _research/data-inventory.md, projects/ |
| Writes | notes/ (claims), _research/cycles/ (cycle mode), self/goals.md |

**Architecture:** Main-context orchestrator with three fork sub-skills:
- `init-orient` -- vault state reading
- `init-generate` -- claim generation (orientation, methodology, confounders, inversions)
- `init-wire` -- graph wiring (topic maps, project bridges, goal updates)

**Seed mode** (default): natural conversation flow -- goal selection, core questions interview, demo claim walkthrough (user composes one claim interactively), batch generation of remaining claims, grouped review, and graph wiring. Uses /onboard artifacts to pre-populate generation. For multiple goals, seeds one at a time (depth-first).

**Cycle mode** (`--cycle`): research cycle transition -- generates cycle summary, refreshes assumption inversions with new evidence, reconciles daemon recommendations.

---

#### /federation-sync
Sync claims and hypotheses across federated vaults.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Input | Remote vault identifier or sync config |
| Output | Synchronized claims and hypotheses, conflict report |

Synchronizes selected claims and hypotheses between federated vault instances. Detects conflicts, preserves provenance, and logs sync operations.
